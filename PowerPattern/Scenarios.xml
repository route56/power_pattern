			The form contains current battery info.
			The form contains previous battery info in graph form.
			Export to CVS for more analysis (beta feature only)

			Predicting critical battery time
			Predicting charge time.

			Account for standby interruptions
			Log event of standby on
			Log event of standby resume

			Also note load factor parms
			CPU usage
			Mem load
			HDD activity
			Wifi/Network

			The app itself is less processor and ram intense. Light weight.
			Able to export to excel. CSV.
